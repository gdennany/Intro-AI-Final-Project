# B351-Final-Project

Final group project for CSCI-B 351 Intro to Artificial Intelligence at Indiana University. Created an AI that plays heads up Texas Holdem Poker. Strict timeline and late bug encounters caused the code to get a liiiittle messy, nevertheless, the final ai works well. 

Used mainly different probability techniques (Bayes, Conditional, Game Theory) and  Decision Tree to create a functional AI that places logical bets based on its hand, probable hands of the other player, the other players bets, and the pot amount of both players. There is also implementation for the AI to occasionally bluff, and detect when the other player may be bluffing.

Run the file titled Gameplay to play the AI ("python Gameplay.py").
