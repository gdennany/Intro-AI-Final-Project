# B351-Final-Project

Final group project for CSCI-B 351 Intro to Artificial Intelligence at Indiana University. Created an AI that plays heads up Texas Holdem. Strict timeline and late bug encounters caused the code to get pretty sloppy, but hey, the ai works well. 

To run navigate the directory you have all these files in and type "python Gameplay.py".
