# B351-Final-Project

Final group project for CSCI-B 351 Intro to Artificial Intelligence at Indiana University. Created an AI that plays heads up Texas Holdem. Strict timeline and late bug encounters caused the code to get a liiiittle sloppy, but hey, the ai works well. 

Used mainly different probability techniques (Bayes, Conditional, Game Theory) and  Decision Tree to create a functional AI that places logical bets based on its hand, probable hands of the other player, and the other players bets. There is also implementation for the AI to occasionally bluff, and detect when the other player may be bluffing.

To run navigate the directory you have all these files in and type "python Gameplay.py".
